# Concurrent-CW2
The overarching goal of this assignment is to develop an initially
simple but then increasingly capable operating system kernel. 
It should execute and thus manage resources on a specific ARM-based target platform, 
namely a RealView Platform Baseboard for Cortex-A8 [1] emulated by QEMU2. 
The capabilities of said platform suggest a remit for the kernel, or, equivalently, a motivating context: 
if and when it makes sense to do so, imagine the platform and kernel form an embedded, consumer electronics product (e.g., set-top box3 or media center).
